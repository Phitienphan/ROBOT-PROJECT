## Introduction

Solar power systems have an important role in converting energy from solar radiation into electrical energy to serve human life. However, its capacity depends on the amount of sunlight shining in, so ensuring cleanliness on the face is quite important. Therefore, this paper proposes a robot which cleans solar panel, the surface of the panel is cleaned by spraying the liquid and wiping out the dust with cylindrical brush
